# ## Introduction
# A renowned online learning portal, Udemy provides a huge selection of courses on a variety of subjects. Udemy has transformed how people study by giving both students and teachers a platform to connect from all over the world thanks to its user-friendly interface and accessibility.
# 
# Learners may choose from a wide range of courses in areas such as programming, business, the arts, personal development, and more, while teachers can impart their knowledge and skills to a worldwide audience. Udemy.com offers an accessible and adaptable learning experience for people of different backgrounds and interests, whether you're wanting to improve your abilities, follow a new hobby, or progress your career.

# ### In  this project
# 
# We will be exploring a dataset of of over 209,734 courses and 73,514 instructors teaching courses in 79 languages in 13 different categories.
# 
# We will be analyzing this dataset to gain insights into various aspects of courses , including :
# 
# The Popularity of Categories and Subcategories.
# 
# >1. Pricing Analysis.
# >2. Instructor Performance Analysis.
# >3. Time Analysis.

# ## Data Source
# The offered dataset includes a thorough compilation of data from user reviews and Udemy course comments. This dataset, which has 20 columns and a total of 209,734 items, provides insightful information about several facets of online learning. The columns include a variety of data kinds, such as text, boolean values, and floating-point integers.
# 
# Important columns contain information about course names, costs, subscribers, ratings, reviews, comments, and instructor profiles. The dataset also offers details about the course's duration, publication,Â update dates, category, subcategory, topic, language, and links to the sites of the teacher and the course.

# 
# 
# 
# - The Udemy Courses Comments dataset analysis reveals important findings. As popular course categories, IT & Software, Development, Teaching & Academics, Personal Development, and Business have evolved. Other IT & Web Development, IT Certifications, Language Learning, and Programming Languages are some of the subcategories that have seen growth.
# 
# - The Development category's "Java Tutorial for Complete Beginners" course received the most subscribers (1,752,367).
# 
# 
# 
# - Nearly 94.4% of courses cost less than $200, demonstrating affordability and accessibility. According to subscription numbers, Learn Tech Plus, TJ Walker, Phil Ebiner, YouAccel Tanning, and Star-Tech Academy are the top teachers.
# 
# 
# 
# - In terms of experience, the most courses were released by Packet Publishing, Bluelime Learning Solutions, lllumeo Learning, Laurence Svekis, and Infinite Skills.
# 
# - The temporal study shows steady subscriber growth that peaks in 2020 and then starts to decline in early 2021. With over 120,730,813 members, 2020 was notable for having the most users.
# 
# - These results indicate how widely used online education is, how diverse the course categories are, and how cost, teacher effectiveness, and temporal patterns affect user involvement.
# 
# - These findings offer useful information to Udemy and its stakeholders, highlighting the platform's role in promoting affordable education and a vibrant online learning community.
